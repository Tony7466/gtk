<h2 id="WhatIsGTK"><a name="WhatIsGTK">What is GTK+, and how can I use it?</a></h2>

<p><span id="intro">GTK+</span>, or the GIMP Toolkit, is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.</p>

<dl>
	<dt id="WhereCanIUseIt">Where can I use it?</dt>
	<dd>Everywhere! GTK+ is cross-platform and boasts an easy to use API, speeding up your development time. Take a look at the <a href="screenshots/">screenshots</a> to see a number of platforms GTK+ will run.</dd>

	<dt id="WhatLanguages">What languages are supported?</dt>
	<dd>GTK+ is written in C but has been designed from the ground up to support a <a href="language-bindings.php">wide range of languages</a>, not only C/C++. Using GTK+ from languages such as Perl and Python (especially in combination with the <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/" class="external">Glade GUI builder</a>) provides an effective method of rapid application development.</dd>

	<dt id="AreThereRestrictions">Are there any licensing restrictions?</dt>
	<dd>GTK+ is free software and part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/" class="external">GNU Project</a>. However, the licensing terms for GTK+, the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html" class="external">GNU LGPL</a>, allow it to be used by all developers, including those developing proprietary software, without any license fees or royalties.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Get an <a href="overview.php">overview</a> of GTK+. Understand who started it, the basic architecture and why we use the license we do.</p>

<p>GTK+ has been involved in many <a href="http://www.gtk-apps.org/" class="external">projects</a> and some big platforms. To get a glimpse of what people think of GTK+ and how it has been used in commercial projects, <a href="commerce.php">read the success stories...</a></p>
