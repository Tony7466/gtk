Mar 28 22:31:59 <mclasen>	hmm, so federico seems to be out for lunch...
Mar 28 22:32:06 <mclasen>	and kris is not here today
Mar 28 22:33:49 <mclasen>	I didn'
Mar 28 22:33:51 <mclasen>	grr
Mar 28 22:34:12 <ebassi>	hehe
Mar 28 22:34:37 <mclasen>	I didn't send out an agenda, so we can talk about whatever people feel like...
Mar 28 22:35:22 <mclasen>	one thing I wanted to confirm is that we seem to have at least 3 glib/gtk+ talks for guadec
Mar 28 22:35:58 <mclasen>	kris/rambokid on 2.10, alex/j5 on printing, and a tutorial on gobject and modules 
Mar 28 22:38:03 <mclasen>	another thing we may want to talk about is the recent files patch
Mar 28 22:39:17 <ebassi>	I haven't received feedback from xdg
Mar 28 22:39:38 <mclasen>	I saw your mail and meant to reply. I'll do that later 
Mar 28 22:40:00 <ebassi>	I'll ping a couple of people that replied the first time
Mar 28 22:40:11 <mclasen>	Was there more interest when you first brought it up last year ?
Mar 28 22:40:45 <ebassi>	kde people wanted to get recent files support right, and supported the xbel format
Mar 28 22:41:12 <mclasen>	ebassi: maybe you could poke one of them directly, to get some reaction ?
Mar 28 22:41:26 <ebassi>	I'll do that
Mar 28 22:41:43 <mclasen>	maybe everybody is too busy inventing crap with desktop files...
Mar 28 22:42:07 <ebassi>	mclasen: or reinventing the .pif files
Mar 28 22:43:40 <mclasen>	ebassi: so, how do you imagine recent-files <-> filechooser integration would look like ?
Mar 28 22:44:06 <mclasen>	ebassi: would the recent files just be additional entries in the bookmark pane, or  would they completely replace traditional bookmarks ?
Mar 28 22:44:16 <ebassi>	I'd put a list of recently used files in the left pane, above the shortcuts
Mar 28 22:44:30 <ebassi>	small list (4/6 items)
Mar 28 22:44:45 <dom>	mclasen: there are about 250 bugs in gtk+'s bugzilla with patches. maybe we could organize a bugday or something to get some of those reviewed?
Mar 28 22:44:45 <ebassi>	or an item replacing the file list
Mar 28 22:45:15 <mclasen>	did federico have plans to store the user-defined bookmarks as recent files as well, instead of .gtk-bookmarks ?
Mar 28 22:45:47 <ebassi>	mclasen: don't know
Mar 28 22:45:52 <ebassi>	dom: at guadec?
Mar 28 22:46:20 <dom>	ebassi: that is a fine suggestion
Mar 28 22:46:43 <ebassi>	dom: during the warm up sessions, like the performance hackfest proposed by behdad
Mar 28 22:46:49 <ebassi>	dom: could be an idea
Mar 28 22:47:52 <mclasen>	dom: the reality is that we need more people to pay regular attention to GTK+ bugzilla, otherwise there is no way to shrink the number
Mar 28 22:48:02 <mclasen>	of open bugs/unreviewed patches
Mar 28 22:48:50 <dom>	mclasen: i'd happily help out with that and glib
Mar 28 22:48:57 <mclasen>	we have a constant influx of crasher bugs, just because gnome stacktraces have a natural tendency to have glib/gtk functions near the top...
Mar 28 22:50:05 <dom>	of course. i'm just referring to the subset of bugs where people have taken the time to create a patch at the moment
Mar 28 22:50:10 <ebassi>	mclasen: glib and gtk+ do not have a specific triaging guides
Mar 28 22:50:26 <ebassi>	mclasen: http://live.gnome.org/Bugsquad/TriageGuide/ProductSpecificGuidelines
Mar 28 22:50:57 <mclasen>	we have http://www.gtk.org/bugs.html, which was put together about a year ago
Mar 28 22:51:23 <carol>	i am, at best, just an observer. but the new bugzilla interface makes it easy to put specific searches on a web site.  it has helped me find ways i could help occasionally with gimp stuff.
Mar 28 22:51:44 <ebassi>	mclasen: I'll link that up on the guidelines
Mar 28 22:52:49 <mclasen>	ebassi: thanks
Mar 28 22:54:43 <carol>	http://bugs.gtk.org/
Mar 28 22:57:12 <rambokid>	mclasen: any bugs that are in some way maemo related can be put into kris/mitch/my queue. don't know whether there are some beyond the ones we filed ourselves though.
Mar 28 22:57:57 <mclasen>	rambokid: I doubt it
Mar 28 22:58:02 <rambokid>	yeah.
Mar 28 22:59:15 <carol>	http://parasites.gimp.org/ is what i did.  i have no idea what searches would be useful for toolkit bugs, but the software was very very (almost too) easy to work with. i dunno if this would be helpful for gtk or not. is gtk.org still hosted on wilber?  i would volunteer to get the page working, and it is within my limited ability to do this, if anyone thinks it would be useful.
Mar 28 22:59:58 <carol>	parasites uses simple searches for new and fixed bugs
Mar 28 23:00:38 <carol>	i have no developer feedback to measure usefulness with, btw. i only know it helped me. bugzilla is perhaps too powerful of a tool to start right out with...
Mar 28 23:02:02 <mclasen>	carol: gnome bugzilla has pretty good search support, with the product page, etc. searching for bugs is not really the problem
Mar 28 23:02:15 <carol>	mclasen: perhaps too good though
Mar 28 23:02:25 <mitch>	i need to run...
Mar 28 23:02:25 <mclasen>	although it would be nice to give names to frequent dupes
Mar 28 23:03:47 <carol>	additional "navigation" with saved searched on the web page
Mar 28 23:03:59 <mclasen>	anyway, to make this more concrete, it would be great if some people could help out with looking over some of the open crasher bugs in
Mar 28 23:04:02 <mclasen>	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?product=gtk%2B&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_severity=critical
Mar 28 23:04:09 <carol>	you have your "gnomelove" stuff, this would be perhaps more like gtk reality
Mar 28 23:04:20 <mclasen>	since we
Mar 28 23:04:34 <mclasen>	since I am going to do stable releases next week for gnome 2.14.1
Mar 28 23:06:04 <ebassi>	vuntz submitted a proposal to hold a bugday at guadec
Mar 28 23:06:20 <behdad>	mclasen: there's a gtk+ rtl bug I should fix for 2.14.1...
Mar 28 23:06:50 <behdad>	we've not had any bugfix in pango yet!
Mar 28 23:07:21 <mclasen>	behdad: which one is it, and can you fix it ?
Mar 28 23:07:47 <behdad>	mclasen: it's one about the cellrenderer.  there's a patch attached. I can manage it.
Mar 28 23:08:35 *	behdad finds it
Mar 28 23:17:34 <behdad>	so the meeting is already over?
Mar 28 23:18:59 <mclasen>	behdad: I'm still here for another 10 minutes or so
Mar 28 23:21:06 <mclasen>	behdad: so, are there no pango bugs to fix ?
Mar 28 23:21:26 <behdad>	mclasen: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157439
Mar 28 23:23:04 <behdad>	mclasen: there are a couple really minor pango bugs that I can fix, but they aren't really worth a release even.
Mar 28 23:23:39 <mclasen>	behdad: you could always make it faster :-)
Mar 28 23:24:17 <behdad>	mclasen: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335840 and http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=334802 I mean
Mar 28 23:24:28 <behdad>	mclasen: right, but performance doesn't go into stable releases ;)
Mar 28 23:24:50 <mclasen>	those are indeed not release-worthy
Mar 28 23:25:25 <mclasen>	behdad: I agree in principle; though I would kind of hope that we could backport the nautilus/b-a-s startup time fixes for 2.14.1
Mar 28 23:26:02 <behdad>	mclasen: true.  they make a huge difference to become exceptions :)
Mar 28 23:27:18 <mclasen>	we may backport then for fc5 anyway, but it would be nicer to have them officially in 2.14.x
Mar 28 23:33:41 <mclasen>	ok, I'm heading out
Mar 28 23:34:13 <ebassi>	mclasen: bye then :-)
Mar 28 23:35:33 <behdad>	ebassi|dinner: do you propose the gtk+ bugfest then, or should I?
Mar 28 23:36:57 <ebassi|dinner>	vuntz proposed a bugfest
Mar 28 23:37:29 <behdad>	perfect.  should be a very fun warmup weekend
Mar 28 23:37:51 <ebassi|dinner>	behdad: http://beta.guadec.org/node/214
Mar 28 23:38:59 <ebassi|dinner>	behdad: hope to get to the warmup weekend - it'll be fun indeed
Mar 28 23:39:25 <ebassi|dinner>	but now, I really have to go to eat something ;-)
Mar 28 23:39:44 <behdad>	:)
Mar 29 00:22:36 <jody>	mclasen: How about something like http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332266
