Hey! So, the current period is meant for getting to know the project and start planning for the actual implementation
ravgeetdhillon: Since we're planning to replace the website, submitting patches is kind of pointless :-)
ravgeetdhillon: But a good start would be to gather all the text on the existing website and identifying the bits that can be kept and those that can be removed
ravgeetdhillon: You can reach me over email at ebassi@gnome.org

great.

ravgeetdhillon: Another good thing to do would be to go through the current gtk.org structure and create a site map, with the whole tree of the site, and the various links between sections
We can put this up on the wiki; actually, let me create a wiki page that we can work on together
ravgeetdhillon: Do you have an account on wiki.gnome.org?
ravgeetdhillon
For now I don't have any
But if it's needed I can surely make one?

I created this wiki page, and we can use it as a shared workspace: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK/WebsiteRedesign
You should be able to edit it
ravgeetdhillon: As I said, the next step is to break down the existing site; create the site map, the cross references, all the external links, and the various assets used in it
ravgeetdhillon: Also, all the content in terms of text
ravgeetdhillon: Then we can start reworking the site, and see what we can keep and what we have to redo
