Hi; the current GTK website is generated with this: https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/gtk-web
E
Ideally, we'd like to move it to something else: https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Engagement/General/issues/70
Ggitlab-botGimpnet IRC Network (+gimpnet:matrix.org)
Engagement issue 70 in General "GTK website refresh" [Accepted, Opened]
G
ebassiGimpnet IRC Network (+gimpnet:matrix.org)
Possibly, using a new static web generator, using GitLab CI to publish the content
E
But, for an initial step, it would be great to generate part of the current website using the data from the GitLab project
For instance, the list of releases; or the latest changes in master.
Having the feed from the development blog in the landing page

Rravgeetdhillon: Great!

Great! Having a structure for the website would be good, then we can gather the copy as well as define the various assets that we can ask from the design team. Additionally, I'd like to get integration with GitLab

Like being able to see the list of recent issues, or the list of recent milestones/branches, and the top contributors
